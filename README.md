# Conbine

Conbine is a subset of ConboJS for use in combination with your favourite view framework, including React, or server-side applications using Node.js.

The library enables developers to add features including an event bus, command pattern and property injection, supported by an easy to use event model, while only adding around 3KB to your project when minified and gzipped.
